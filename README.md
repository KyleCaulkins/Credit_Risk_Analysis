# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to compare two machine learning models and their ability to detect risky loans. The data is from **LendingClub**, and in its raw form is very unbalanced. There are far more good loans than risky loans, which is representative of the current market. Oversampling, undersampling, and a combination approach (oversampling & undersampling) are used to train models with less bias. With good data being provided, two machine learning models **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, are used to prediect credit risk.

For further detail the code can be viewed [here](/challenge/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) and [here.](/challenge/credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb)

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
